To run this code git and conda will need to be installed on your computer. 
Instructions for installing git can be found: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git 
Anaconda installation instruction can be found: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html 

To install the environment on your machine first clone the repository to your machine using the command prompt git clone, e.g. $ git clone https://github.com/GregMcS/egm722soil.git. This will clone the repository to your machine and download the necessary files. 

To create the conda environment use the conda prompt to navigate to the folder the files were cloned to and use conda to create the environment, e.g. C:\Users\gregm> conda env create -f environment.yml. This may take some time. 

Using the Anaconda Navigator switch your environment to egm722soil and launch Jupyter-notebook. A new tab will open in your web browser with a folder plan. Select the Jupyter-notebook to begin.
